 Web server scripts to inject JavaScript or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser.
 
This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,
 which do not adequately filter data sent along with page requests or by vulnerable HTTP servers.

This malicious code appears to come from your Web application when it runs in the browser of an unsuspecting user.</p>

<li>access other sites inside another client&#39;s private intranet</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s submitted form data</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s submitted form data before it reaches the server</li>
<li>submit a form to your Web application on the user&#39;s behalf that modifies passwords or other application data</li></ul>

 Web server scripts to inject JavaScript or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser.
 
This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,

 Web server scripts to inject JavaScript or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser.
 
This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,
 which do not adequately filter data sent along with page requests or by vulnerable HTTP servers.

This malicious code appears to come from your Web application when it runs in the browser of an unsuspecting user.</p>


<p>An attacker can do the following damage with an expoloit script:


<ul>
<li>access other sites inside another client&#39;s private intranet</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s submitted form data</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s submitted form data before it reaches the server</li>
<li>submit a form to your Web application on the user&#39;s behalf that modifies passwords or other application data</li></ul>

</p>



<p>The two most common methods of attack are:

<ul>
<li>Having a user click a URL link sent in an e-mail</li>
<li>Having a user click  a URL link while visiting a Web site</li></ul>
</p>


<p>In both scenarios, the URL will generally link to the trusted site, but will contain additional data that is used to
 trigger the XSS attack.</p>

<li>Having a user click  a URL link while visiting a Web site</li></ul>

 Web server scripts to inject JavaScript or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser.
 
This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,
 which do not adequately filter data sent along with page requests or by vulnerable HTTP servers.

This malicious code appears to come from your Web application when it runs in the browser of an unsuspecting user.</p>

<li>access other sites inside another client&#39;s private intranet</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s submitted form data</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s submitted form data before it reaches the server</li>
<li>submit a form to your Web application on the user&#39;s behalf that modifies passwords or other application data</li></ul>

 Web server scripts to inject JavaScript or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser.
 
This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,
 which do not adequately filter data sent along with page requests or by vulnerable HTTP servers.

This malicious code appears to come from your Web application when it runs in the browser of an unsuspecting user.</p>

<li>access other sites inside another client&#39;s private intranet</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s submitted form data</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s submitted form data before it reaches the server</li>
<li>submit a form to your Web application on the user&#39;s behalf that modifies passwords or other application data</li></ul>

This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,
 which do not adequately filter data sent along with page requests or by vulnerable HTTP servers.

This malicious code appears to come from your Web application when it runs in the browser of an unsuspecting user.</p>


<p>An attacker can do the following damage with an expoloit script:


<ul>
<li>access other sites inside another client&#39;s private intranet</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s submitted form data</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s submitted form data before it reaches the server</li>
<li>submit a form to your Web application on the user&#39;s behalf that modifies passwords or other application data</li></ul>

</p>



<p>The two most common methods of attack are:

<ul>
<li>Having a user click a URL link sent in an e-mail</li>
<li>Having a user click  a URL link while visiting a Web site</li></ul>
</p>


<p>In both scenarios, the URL will generally link to the trusted site, but will contain additional data that is used to
 trigger the XSS attack.</p>

This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,
 which do not adequately filter data sent along with page requests or by vulnerable HTTP servers.

This malicious code appears to come from your Web application when it runs in the browser of an unsuspecting user.</p>


<p>An attacker can do the following damage with an expoloit script:


<ul>
<li>access other sites inside another client&#39;s private intranet</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>steal another client&#39;s submitted form data</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s submitted form data before it reaches the server</li>
<li>submit a form to your Web application on the user&#39;s behalf that modifies passwords or other application data</li></ul>

</p>



<p>The two most common methods of attack are:

<ul>
<li>Having a user click a URL link sent in an e-mail</li>
<li>Having a user click  a URL link while visiting a Web site</li></ul>
</p>


<p>In both scenarios, the URL will generally link to the trusted site, but will contain additional data that is used to
 trigger the XSS attack.</p>

 Web server scripts to inject JavaScript or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser.
 
This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,

<li>steal another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>

 Web server scripts to inject JavaScript or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser.
 
This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,
 which do not adequately filter data sent along with page requests or by vulnerable HTTP servers.

<li>steal another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>
<li>modify another client&#39;s cookie(s)</li>

 Web server scripts to inject JavaScript or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser.
 
This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java,
